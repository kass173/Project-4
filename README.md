For our 4th project we’ve decided to look at and analyse data relating to star’s. 

Firstly after deciding the members of our group and getting together we looked at  various data sets across various topic categories mainly used Kaggle & google searches to find our dataset.

We came to a general group consensus on our final dataset related to “star dataset for stellar classification” (star-categorization-giants-and-dwarfs). 

So this will be the problem/topic we wanted to analyse and visualise.

Next in our group we looked at deciding if we should do supervised or unsupervised machine learning at the moment we are leaning toward unsupervised 
machine learning. And we will also be using Scikit-learn as the main library to import well as other machine learning such as random forest possibly.

Also decided what of the following programming language we wanted to use such as panda’s, python matplotlib as well as Tableau to create a dashboard to 
showcase our data in a nice final visualisation.
